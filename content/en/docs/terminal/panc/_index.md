## Positions

{{< positions "panc" >}}

## General Notes

1. ANC LC is responsible for all aircraft operating on the ANC Class C surface area, including LHD aircraft unless the LHD LC position is opened

## Clearance Delivery

1. IFR Aircraft
   1. Initial altitude is 4,000 feet
   2. All aircraft should be assigned a SID appropriate for the active runways. Aircraft unable to accept a SID should be assigned a heading and altitude that mirrors that of the ANC # SID.
      1. Example (Runway 33 Departure): "Alaska 50, Cleared to the Barrow Airport as filed. On departure, fly runway heading. Passing through 600, turn left heading 301. Maintain 4000. Expect FL360 10 minutes after departure. Departure frequency 118.6. Squawk 1234."
   3. Departure Frequencies, when both sectors are opened:
      1. ANC# (Anchorage #) - 118.6 (North Radar)
      2. FFITZ# (Fitz #) - 126.4 (South Radar)
      3. KNIK# (Ka-nick #) - 118.6 (North Radar)
      4. NOEND# (No End #) - 118.6 (North Radar)
      5. POTTER# (Potter #) - 126.4 (South Radar)
      6. TURNA# (Turn-again #) - 126.4 (South Radar)
2. VFR Aircraft
   1. Should be instructed to remain VFR at or below 4,000 or otherwise directed by approach
   2. If both sectors are opened: aircraft traveling from 250 clockwise to 070 should be given a departure frequency of 118.6, otherwise 126.4. Otherwise, use the frequency of the open sector.
3. LHD Aircraft
   1. If the aircraft is at LHD but requesting IFR, advise that IFR operations from LHD are not authorized
   2. VFR aircraft should contact LHD LC or ANC LC for departure instructions

## Ground Control

1. When Runway 7/33 in use:
   1. Assign Runway 33 for departing:
      1. Wake Category A-E turbojets
      2. DC-6 and other aircraft unable to comply with climb gradient
      3. Northbound aircraft
   2. Assign Runway 7 for departing:
      1. All other aircraft
      2. All southbound aircraft
2. LHD aircraft should be advised to contact LHD LC or ANC LC for departure instructions

## ANC Local Control

1. Retains control of ground traffic between the 7/25 parallels and west of Runway 15/33
2. Ensure aircraft commence the first turn of the SID prior to switching to departure

### Runway selection guidance

Primary runways are based on traffic, forecasted wind, weather and neighboring traffic flows:

1. Arrival runways:
   1. First preference: 7L/7R, or 15
   2. Second preference: 33
   3. Last preference: 25L/25R
2. Departure runways:
   1. First preference: 33 and 7L
   2. Second preference: <u>Day</u> 7L/7R, <u>Night</u> 25L/25R
   3. Last preference: 15
3. Day is defined as 0700-2200 local time. Night is defined as 2200-0700 local time.
4. Selection of preference is based off of:
   1. Wind, including gusts, resulting in 15 knot crosswind or 5 knot tailwind or greater
   2. Wind shear, reported or forecasted

### Primary Diverse Vector Area

Primary Diverse Vector Area defines departure headings for IFR departures may be issued for operational efficiency as listed. These headings must be coordinated with,
but not need approval from, the appropriate departure controller. LC sohudl take care to ensure there is no conflicting traffic by utilzing the Tower Display Workstation (TDW).

1. Runway 7L: Right turn 206 clockwise to 253, left turn 254 clockwise to 004.
2. Runway 7R: Not authorized
3. Runway 15: Not authorized
4. Runway 25L/25R: 185 clockwise to 015
5. Runway 33: 185 clockwise to 015

## LHD Local Control

1. Operated from ANC LC and is combined with ANC LC when not staffed
2. Identifies as "Lake Hood Tower" only when staffed
3. Issues VFR departure instructions to keep aircraft clear of the ANC departing and arriving traffic

## Appendices

### Appendix A. Airspace

{{< image width="80%" link="./airspace.png" caption="Anchorage area airspace delegations" >}}

LC is delegated airspace as depicted from surface up to and including 2,500 feet MSL.
This area is defined as 090 bearing from the ANC ATCT to New Seward Highway, then
south along New Seward Highway to a 5.2 nautical mile radius, then clockwise along the
5.2nm radius to the EDF runway 6 localizer, then east along the localizer to a line that
extends from Pt McKenzie direct to the Mouth of Fish Creek, then direct to the Northern
Lights Blvd railroad bridge, then direct to the intersection of Tudor Road and New
Seward Highway, then along New Seward Highway back to the starting point.
